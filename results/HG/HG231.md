## Scenario
```gherkin
scenario: 
   given a user is logged in 
   when they visit the dashboard page 
   then they should see a list of their recent orders 
   and they should see a list of their favorite products 
   and they should see a list of their recent searches 
   and they should see a list of their account activity 
   and they should see a button to add a new product to their favorites 
   and they should see a button to remove a product from their favorites 
   and they should see a button to view more information about a recent order 
   and they should see a button to initiate a live chat with customer support 
   and they should see a button to view their account activity in more detail 
   and they should see a button to log out
```


## Python Implementation
```python
from behave import given, when, then

@given("a user is logged in")
def step_impl(context):
    pass

@when("they visit the dashboard page")
def step_impl(context):
    pass

@then("they should see a list of their recent orders")
def step_impl(context):
    pass

@then("they should see a list of their favorite products")
def step_impl(context):
    pass

@then("they should see a list of their recent searches")
def step_impl(context):
    pass

@then("they should see a list of their account activity")
def step_impl(context):
    pass

@then("they should see a button to add a new product to their favorites")
def step_impl(context):
    pass

@then("they should see a button to remove a product from their favorites")
def step_impl(context):
    pass

@then("they should see a button to view more information about a recent order")
def step_impl(context):
    pass

@then("they should see a button to initiate a live chat with customer support")
def step_impl(context):
    pass

@then("they should see a button to view their account activity in more detail")
def step_impl(context):
    pass

@then("they should see a button to log out")
def step_impl(context):
    pass
```
