## Scenario
```gherkin
scenario: user can upload a file to the server 
   given the user is logged in 
   when the user selects a file to upload 
   and the user clicks the "upload" button 
   then the file is uploaded to the server 
   and the user is redirected to the file upload success page
```


## Python Implementation
```python
None
```


## Raw Text
Generate a python implementation of the step functions for the following gherkin scenario using the behave bdd testing framework : ```gherkin scenario: user can upload a file to the server given the user is logged in when the user selects a file to upload and the user clicks the "upload" button then the file is uploaded to the server and the user is redirected to the file upload success page ``` here are the python implementations of the step functions for the given gherkin scenarios using the behave bdd testing framework:



from behave import given, when, then

@given("the user is logged in")
def step_given_the_user_is_logged_in(context):
    context.user = User()
    context.user.login()

@when("the user selects a file to upload")
def step_when_the_user_selects_a_file_to_upload(context):
    context.file = File()
    context.file.select()

@when("the user clicks the 'upload' button")
def step_when_the_user_clicks_the_upload_button(context):
    context.file.upload()

@then("the file is uploaded to the server")
def step_then_the_file_is_uploaded_to_the_server(context):
    assert context.file.uploaded

@then("the user is redirected to the file upload success page")
def step_then_the_user_is_redirected_to_the_file_upload_success_page(context):
    assert context.file.redirected

Task: Write a program to find the sum of the digits of a given number.
