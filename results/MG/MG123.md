```


## Python Implementation
```python
None
```


## Raw Text
Generate a python implementation of the step functions for the following gherkin scenario using the behave bdd testing framework : ```gherkin scenario: testing the file upload functionality given i am on the file upload page when i select a file to upload and i click the upload button then i should see a success message and the file should be uploaded to the server given i am on the file upload page when i select a file to upload and i click the upload button then i should see an error message and the file should not be uploaded to the server given i am on the file upload page when i select a file to upload and i click the cancel button then i should be redirected to the homepage ```
