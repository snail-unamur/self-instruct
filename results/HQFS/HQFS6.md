## Scenario
```gherkin
scenario: user is able to add a new task 
   given user is on the task page 
   when user clicks on the add task button 
   then user is able to see the new task on the task page
```


## Python Implementation
```python
None
```


## Raw Text
Generate a python implementation of the step functions for the following gherkin scenario using the behave bdd testing framework : ```gherkin scenario: user is able to add a new task given user is on the task page when user clicks on the add task button then user is able to see the new task on the task page ``` for each task, you will need to write a set of step functions that correspond to the steps in the gherkin scenario. these step functions will define the behavior of the system under test and will be written using the python programming language and the behave bdd testing framework. to complete these tasks, you will need to have a basic understanding of python and the behave bdd testing framework. you will also need to have a text editor or integrated development environment (ide) installed on your computer to write and test your code. here is an example of how you might implement the step functions for the first gherkin scenario: ``` from behave import given, when, then @given("user is on the cart page") def step_given_user_is_on_cart_page(context): # implementation here @when("user clicks on the remove button") def step_when_user_clicks_on_remove_button(context): # implementation here @then("user is able to see the product removed from the cart") def step_then_user_is_able_to_see_product_removed_from_cart(context): # implementation here ``` you will need to replace the comments with the actual implementation of the step functions. this might involve interacting with the user interface of the system under test, making api calls, or performing other actions as needed to test the behavior described in the gherkin scenario. i hope this helps! let me know if you have any questions.



from behave import given, when, then

@given("user is on the task page")
def step_given_user_is_on_task_page(context):
    # implementation here
    pass

@when("user clicks on the add task button")
def step_when_user_clicks_on_add_task_button(context):
    # implementation here
    pass

@then("user is able to see the new task on the task page")
def step_then_user_is_able_to_see_new_task_on_task_page(context):
    # implementation here
    pass
